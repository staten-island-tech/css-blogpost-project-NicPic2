      One day, Octavio Silva was bored. In fact, he was bored most days. Son of
      the preoccupied CEO of Silva Pharmaceuticals and wanting for nothing in
      life, he entertained himself by performing death-defying stunts and
      posting holovids of them for his fans to gawk over. So, this day, he
      decided to set the course record for a nearby Gauntlet by launching
      himself across the finish line â€“ using a grenade.

      Pathfinder is the picture of optimism, despite his circumstances. A MRVN
      (Mobile Robotic Versatile eNtity) modified to specialize in location
      scouting and surveying, he booted up decades ago in an abandoned warehouse
      with no idea who created him or why. With only his MRVN designation to
      hint at his identity, Pathfinder eventually set off in search of his
      creator.
